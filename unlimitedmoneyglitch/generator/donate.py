#[patch 1, for winlog grab chumps out of player library then append, since we remove them from regular list. reset all users money apin]
#[patch 1 when generate key in update take money from admin]




#do not upload umgroup to git with api key no no 
#and encrypt private key

#you need to put your all into this site for the month dont worry about rushing because if you put your all into this site with
#a snap of your finger you will go up dont focus on anything else.





#make a fake api key to monitor when a hacker is attempting to hack your funds basically a trap.
#dont rush. you can always go to your grandmas house, do not rush i repeat do not rush. no matter what.
